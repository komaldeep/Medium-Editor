                Some people blamed me personally. Some thought I was with the bank. Some people lashed out, or their neighbors did for them. I once came to a house and I wasn’t even there to talk to the neighbors and they yelled at me. We had a couple people threaten to use bombs against us. Others threatened to shoot me or murder me.

                I’m Mormon, and Mormons have a scripture that says that when you’re in the service of your fellow man, you’re in the service of your God. That’s one of the things I would constantly recite to myself, because doing this work was partly a religious undertaking for me. I had a responsibility to help everybody to my utmost, because that’s what my religion asks of me.
